      "message": "Yes,  we\u0027ve had instances of pip really messing up the system in gentoo before (we went as far as to disallow system installs in our pip package).\npip now has a use flag that disables this patching (which the pip_and_virtualenv stuff sets).\nAnother reason we did this is because having random untracked files/programs messing with system state is frowned upon.  Just had a developer package glean for that reason...\n\nIf we do need to change from the default (to \u0027package\u0027) we should remove $DIB_GET_PIP though.  otherwise we should remove DIB_INSTALLTYPE_pip_and_virtualenv",
