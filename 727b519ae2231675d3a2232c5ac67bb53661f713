I understand the test below about a missing static node (because it went offline and got deregistered). But I can\u0027t see how we\u0027d get into this situation for this test with an additional ZK node that our config says we should not have. Decreasing the max-parallel-jobs in our config would give us this situation, but we already have a test for that (test_static_parallel_decrease), so what\u0027s the value of this test?\n\nAgain, sorry if I\u0027m missing something obvious. Perhaps a concrete example would help me understand.",
