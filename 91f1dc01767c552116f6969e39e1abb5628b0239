      "message": "The protocol should not allow this to happen.  This method is called very often and the additional ZK traffic is not desirable.\n\nSomething like this needs a test reproduction and if there is a protocol problem, likely a different fix that doesn\u0027t involve zk operations here.",

      "message": "Is there some other way to do it without invoking zookeeper? If you drop this patch and run the test in https://review.opendev.org/c/zuul/nodepool/+/891635 it will hang because the node becomes pending (but will never be fulfilled because of the test setup) and then request is deleted.\n\nIn practice I guess maybe a node would never be stuck in pending state forever.... but it seems like handling that might be a good idea anyway?\n\nAlternative, we drop this if there is a way to \"unstick\" the node in the test in the next patch, I couldn\u0027t figure out a way to do it.",
