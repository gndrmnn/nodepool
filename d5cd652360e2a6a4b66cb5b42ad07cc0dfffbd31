      "message": "This is a bit racey with the min-ready node being recreated (which I suspect is why you chose a longish sleep time here). I think it would be better to have a config file that does not use min-ready and just manually submit a request (several examples in this file). We could reduce that sleep time a bit then (I hate using artificial sleeps, but don\u0027t see a way around this one).\n\nAnd that would also be clearer to understand b/c it took me looking through the logs to figure out why we\u0027d expect 2 nodes (obvious now, but not so much at first glance).\n\nAlso, let\u0027s make sure that the node state is DELETING, as we are expecting it to be.",
