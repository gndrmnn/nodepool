If someone did, we would accept it (the related specs indicate as much too).\n\nThis is an explanation of why we don\u0027t use snapshot builds, but it is not necessarily the case for all users -- and in fact, nodepool does support cloud-supplied images, to which all of the deficiencies you cite here apply.\n\nI think this section is problematic in this document.",
