I think it would be better to have the test class pass through a parameter to the NodePoolBuilder for this, and have it default to 60.  I don\u0027t think we should expose it on the command line or in a config file because I don\u0027t think it\u0027s useful for an operator to tune (but if we decide to in the future, we can).",
