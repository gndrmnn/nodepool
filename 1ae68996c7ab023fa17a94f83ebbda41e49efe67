It seems that most of the tests rely on zookeeper information and miss a lot. \n\nI added an test to check that the image is failed on post_upload_hook failure and it is marked failed in zookeeper. But exception isn\u0027t tracked. Will try to find how to get a list of images from fake provider to verify.",
