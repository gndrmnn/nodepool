      "message": "The name of this option and the description seems overly prescriptive.  Really what this option does is cause quota errors to not be treated as fatal for the provider (and so node requests will be continually retried).  Could we change the name and description to match that, rather than the specific scenario that you want to use it for?  I think it would be okay to also describe your use case in the docs if you want.",
