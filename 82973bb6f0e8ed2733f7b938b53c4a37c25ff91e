The definition, seen here: http://gearman.org/protocol/ does not specify the exact format of the fields. So it might be wise to be resilient to things like \u0027-\u0027 or even \u0027\u0027 instead of \u00270\u0027. I\u0027m not saying try to predict everything, but failing gracefully here with a warning seems in order given the ambiguous spec, and would be preferrable to letting a ValueError thrash its way back up to the call site.\n\nSo maybe\n\n\n    try:\n        queued \u003d int(parts[1])\n    except ValueError as e:\n        self.__log.warn(\u0027Server returned non-integer value in status. (%s)\u0027 % str(e))\n        queued \u003d 0",
