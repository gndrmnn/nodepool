      "message": "I think this change is mixing two ideas; the original StatsReporter was basically a mix-in that added functionality (specifically it added an implementation to report launch stats), and the new StatsReporter is a proxy that masks the presence or absence of a statsd object.\n\nTBH, as we move everything to the statemachine driver, I think the original mix-in class will become less valuable.  But perhaps for now, it would be easiest to keep them separate and make the nex proxy object a new class and leave StatsReporter alone?",
