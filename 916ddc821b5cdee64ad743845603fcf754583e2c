      "message": "My intention would be to make all the hardcoded settings from nodepool/nodepool.py to be configurable.  Eg:\n\n WATERMARK_SLEEP \u003d 10         # Interval between checking if new servers needed\n IMAGE_TIMEOUT \u003d 6 * HOURS    # How long to wait for an image save\n CONNECT_TIMEOUT \u003d 10 * MINS  # How long to try to connect after a server\n                              # is ACTIVE\n NODE_CLEANUP \u003d 8 * HOURS     # When to start deleting a node that is not\n                              # READY or HOLD\n TEST_CLEANUP \u003d 5 * MINS      # When to start deleting a node that is in TEST\n IMAGE_CLEANUP \u003d 8 * HOURS    # When to start deleting an image that is not\n                              # READY or is not the current or previous image\n\nAnd I thought it would be a good thing to have them under a \u0027nodepoold\u0027 namespace.\n\n\nShould I amend this change and add the rest of those settings? That would clarify the use case for a \u0027nodepoold\u0027 section.",
