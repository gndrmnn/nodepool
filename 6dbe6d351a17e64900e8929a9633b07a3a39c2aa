      "message": "This seems a bit too detailed for this method (and DRY for the other).  Maybe instead we could just exit early if we have performed a build, let the existing \"reload config\" stuff happen, and then we\u0027ll start this loop over?  The only downside I could see is we could starve image builds if building all the images takes longer than the rebuild interval.\n\nOr if that doesn\u0027t sound great, how about we implement a checkConfig method on the base worker that determines if the config has changed, and if so, exit this loop and restart?",
