      "message": "I noticed nodepool/nodepool.py has a bunch of over global variables (eg: NODE_CLEANUP, IMAGE_CLEANUP...) that we might want to make configurable.  So I thought all of them could eventually land in a new section that is dedicated to Nodepool internal behavior / main loop. I also did not want to pollute the main namespace with a new section delete-delay.\n\nSo in theory later on we could end up with:\n\n nodepoold:\n    delete-delay: 60\n    node-cleanup: 28800  # 8 hours\n    test-cleanup: 300  # 5 minutes\n\nI only bothered with delete-delay since I have a use case for it but still prepared the layout to migrate the rest.   Maybe I should amend to migrate and document the rest  of the global variables?  That would clarify my intention.",
