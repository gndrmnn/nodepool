But if it is needed, I\u0027m not certain that it needs to be run with an empty config file (those won\u0027t really be \u0027new\u0027 images -- most of them will be fine and won\u0027t need to be updated).  But then again, maybe that\u0027s harmless?  However, maybe there\u0027s a good reason to do this that I don\u0027t see yet.",
