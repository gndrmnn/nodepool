      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I agree that it is simpler and more readable. There is a lot of indirection between test functions and test classes and plumbing attributes through to each individual test run. In the past it was pretty straightforward monkey patching (that was a bit wordy), but now we\u0027re maintaining a lot of extra state on various objects to track what our patched state is.",
