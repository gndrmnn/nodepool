      "message": "There is an important difference between gather_hostkeys\u003dfalse and the host-key-checking option:\n\nThe host-key-checking option doesn\u0027t do any connection attempt at all and thus cannot determine if the node is fully booted and reachable.\n\nThe gather_hostkeys\u003dfalse instead just doesn\u0027t do *ssh-keyscan* but still waits until the node is reachable and a connection can be made.\n\nThis difference is essential and I think the host-key-checking option has a bad name now as its purpose is not to inhibit host-key-checking but inhibit any connection attempt.",
