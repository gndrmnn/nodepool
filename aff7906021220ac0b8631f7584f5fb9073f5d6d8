      "message": "So I don\u0027t like this bit - I believe it actually shrinks the generality of nodepool here. The prior configuration could specify any parameter Nova would accept and pass through (e.g. net-id + subnet-id).\n\nInstead, if you did this, I think it would preserve the generality, and allow label resolution:\n\n nics \u003d []\n for network in self.provider.networks:\n     network \u003d dict(network)\n     if \u0027net-label\u0027 in network:\n         network[\u0027net-id\u0027] \u003d self.findNetwork(network.pop(\u0027net-label\u0027)[\u0027id\u0027]\n     nics.append(network)\n         \nbut that said - since we also contribute to nova, isn\u0027t the right thing to do just to do this in Nova itself? Nova can make just as unambiguous a decision as we can...",

      "message": "I would argue the undocumented generality of the previous code as a bad thing which could eventually lead to spurious data getting sent off to Nova. Nodepool should own its config file and not have sections of it sent verbatim off to some remote service. I\u0027m mean like oops, we just sent the Nova API all the passwords because of a config file error...\n\nAs for contributing to Nova... people keep saying that.  What I\u0027m doing here matches how things already work for images so I think we aren\u0027t breaking rules, or incurring technical debt. Perhaps in the long term we do both, but it is arguably easier to do this today in nodepool so I\u0027d say lets just get on w/ it.",
