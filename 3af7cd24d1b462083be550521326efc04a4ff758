Or, since that\u0027s ugly, just indicate in the docs that both name and id are ok.\n\nOR - maybe, what about ``cloudimage`` - to indicate it\u0027s an image that is provided by the cloud?\n\n(I don\u0027t care about the bikeshedding - the important bit is to include in the docs that it can be either name or id)",
