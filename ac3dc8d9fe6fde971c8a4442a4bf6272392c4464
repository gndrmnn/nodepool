      "message": "If feel like this doesn\u0027t quite capture what\u0027s going on with the \"vcpus\" probe here.\n\nIt seems that prior to the recent changes, we would get back a flavor object, but that could have \"0\" vcpu\u0027s listed, per [1]:\n\n\"ah, I guess I know now what is happening: vcpus is not set in the tested flavor and as such param is empty. Previously as part of normalization it was set to 0 in such case. This is a tricky one\"\n\nNow, we get back a flavor that doesn\u0027t have a vcpus field if the flavor doesn\u0027t set it.  This raises a few questions:\n\n* The number of VCPU\u0027s doesn\u0027t seem like an optional component of the flavor?\n* How are you supposed to get how many VCPUs a server instance has then?  Is there something else we should use here?\n* If it\u0027s not there, should we assume \"1\"?  This doesn\u0027t seem documented in openstacksdk [2]\n\n[1] https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/openstacksdk/+/826543\n[2] https://docs.openstack.org/openstacksdk/latest/user/resources/compute/v2/flavor.html#openstack.compute.v2.flavor.Flavor",

      "message": "The comment in [1] is wrong IMO. Whether we check for \"vcpus\" or \"ram\" or \"swap\" or whatever doesn\u0027t matter, either all of them are there or none. The cases that can happen are:\n\na) Very old sdk or very old nova (not supporting microversion 2.47). In this case \"server.flavor\" will be a dict with only .id and .links and we need to consult our \"flavors\" list in order to get details about the flavor.\n\nb) not-too-old sdk and nova: \"server.flavor\" is a dict containing .vcpus, .ram, etc. and we can simply use these values [3].\n\nc) sdk 1.0: the result from b) will be returned as a Flavor object [2], which synthesizes an .id field from .original_name\n\nThe old code tries to distinguish a) and b) by checking for the presence of .id, which is missing in b). But it mishandles c), trying to use the flavors list with the id seens from the Flavor object, which fails and returns None because \"flavors\" is indexed by the flavor (UU)ID only and not by (original_)name. Also, servers may still be running that were created with a flavor that has since been deleted, so we couldn\u0027t find it in our \"flavors\" list even if we were checking by name instead of id.\nSo by checking for .vcpus we simply bundle b) and c) together, since in both cases we will have both vcpus and ram present in the flavor data.\n\n[3] https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/compute/?expanded\u003dshow-server-details-detail#show-server-details",

The old code would then simply fail, but my idea was that calculating a lower bound for the used quota, skipping servers that we don\u0027t have data for, would be still better than not having any quota information at all.",
