      "message": "Perhaps I need another cup of coffee this morning, but I don\u0027t think this is a valid test. Getting the most recent image of the not-removed provider will always be the same. I think what you need to do here is replace both getMostRecentImageUpload calls with assert_listed calls: the first making sure there are two images, the second making sure there is just one.",
