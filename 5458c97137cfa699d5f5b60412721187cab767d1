So it may well persist into the image, perhaps unexpectedly. \n\nIf you keep your logs safe, and audit you don\u0027t leak it as non-root somehow, and ensure the only jobs you run are non-root, it *might* stay secret ... so yeah, just quite a few potential ways to shoot yourself in the proverbial foot.  \n\n[1] https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/diskimage-builder/tree/diskimage_builder/elements/manifests/cleanup.d/01-copy-manifests-dir#n32",
