      "message": "If you do this and the image is not paused, it will be immediately uploaded again.  So you may want to pause the image until you know it will be rebuilt correctly.  Of course, if you know that it will be rebuilt correctly immediately, you can just dib-image-delete the whole thing without pausing.\n\nfuture work: We should make sure that somewhere we explain the aggressive build/upload behavior.  This may not be the right place; that should probably be in a section that generally explains what the nodepool-builder does.  But we should link to it here.",
