      "message": "I have a feeling it\u0027s expected to use nft instead, since Debian currently focuses on that as its default (though keeps iptables available as a legacy fallback for anything which still needs it). Probably just some issue with podman not correctly selecting nft or maybe we don\u0027t have nftables installed? (Though it also doesn\u0027t seem to declare any dependency or recommendation for the nftables package either.)",
