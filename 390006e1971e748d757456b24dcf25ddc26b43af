      "message": "\"which do not re-use READY nodes\" ... that isn\u0027t quite right here?  If this request was satisfied by a ready node above, we wouldn\u0027t have got here.\n\nI\u0027m also not sure what \"wedged\" means in this context? That implies to me that there\u0027s a deadlock-y type situation which I don\u0027t think occurs.\n\nMy suggestion for this comment, if I\u0027m understanding, might be\n\n\"The point of the min-ready nodes is to have nodes on standby for future requests.  When at capacity, it doesn\u0027t make sense to wait for and use resources to speculatively create a node.  Decline this so someone else with capacity can take it\"",
