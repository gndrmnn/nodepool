      "message": "Group and groups are interpreted by the ansible openstack inventory to put nodes in to groups - so adding them here gives us the ability for very little cost to do ansible things on a subset of the nodes in our nodepool- even if that\u0027s just running a query. We may never want to - but we\u0027ll be able to trivially chose to if we fill those in.\n\nThe other values are more for human consumption - but I agree with jhesketh - they should really be in a sub-dict called nodepool for clarity.",
