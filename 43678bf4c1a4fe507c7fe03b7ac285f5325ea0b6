      "message": "One thought about quotas. AWS has separated quotas for some instance families. For the start I think this quota code is fine andcovers the most used instance types.\n\nI wonder if we could improve that later by mapping the quotas to codes-standard for the standard images and cores-p for p instances and so on. This way we could generically cover the individual quotas for the currently 8 different instance quotas.",
