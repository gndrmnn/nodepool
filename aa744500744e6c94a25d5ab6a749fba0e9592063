      "message": "Yes because at various times keystone has decided to use the terms \"tenant\" and \"project\" to refer to a single construct and has also used \"id\" and \"name\" to refer to the same unique identifier. Basically tenant-id, tenant_id, tenant-name, tenant_name, project-id, project_id, project-name, project_name are all valid in oscc to keep people sane depending on when they first wrote their first interaction with keystone.",
