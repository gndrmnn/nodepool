      "message": "But there\u0027s nothing else to compare other than slots; the DiskImage can\u0027t have any attributes that aren\u0027t slots, so it can\u0027t have any private attributes.  If we wanted to set \"_dib_cmd\", we couldn\u0027t unless we added it to slots and then we would be comparing it in __eq__ (unless we filtered it out, which we could also do with __dict__).\n\nAnother option might be to have the ConfigValues construct themselves from a YAML dict, and store the raw YAML dict for comparison.",
