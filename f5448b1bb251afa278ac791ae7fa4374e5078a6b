      "message": "I think instead of the CLI arg, we should add something to the config file.  We have a couple of \"global\" arguments (like build dir, etc), and this could be one.  Or, we could make it a per-image argument (so Tobias can say that his 25 hour build can take 25 hours, but other builds can only take 8).  That\u0027s probably the better option, even though it\u0027s a bit more code.\n\nThe reason I don\u0027t think we should have it on the CLI as it makes it much more difficult to change in some circumstances (eg, image-based deployments), and ultimately, this is related to the content of the system (the specific images that are being built) and not as much to the architecture of the deployment.",
