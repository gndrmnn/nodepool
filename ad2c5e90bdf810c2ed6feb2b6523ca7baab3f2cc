      "message": "The implementation adds the globals before the unit elements list, which means this is useful *only* if you build fedora.  I would think that putting them at the end would be more useful (ie, \"cache some stuff\" element).  But really, I think the ambiguity is problematic.  This is why ordered lists are never merged in Zuul.  I don\u0027t think we should do that here either.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I understand what you mean by \"useful only if you build fedora\".\n\nDIB elements order doesn\u0027t matter as each element internally sets up run parts ordering for each build phase. Whether these come before or after on the command line shouldn\u0027t matter. I guess that means we could technically express this list as a set instead, but I\u0027m not sure yaml can express a set?",
