# We have some out-of-tree of binary dependencies expressed below:

#  * vhd-util is required to create .vhd images, mostly used in
#    Rackspace.  For full details see:
#      https://docs.openstack.org/diskimage-builder/latest/developer/vhd_creation.html
#
#  * debootstrap unmounts /proc in the container causing havoc when
#    using -minimal elements on debuntu.  Two unmerged fixes are in the bullseye version:
#      https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/debootstrap/-/merge_requests/26
#      https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/debootstrap/-/merge_requests/27
#    are at least required.  We also need a later version to support jammy.  We
#    grab from unstable for this reason.

# Podman install mainly for the "containerfile" elements of dib that
# build images from extracts of upstream containers.
# --install-recommends is important for getting some reccommends like
# slirp4netns and uidmap that help with non-root usage -- by default
# our base container sets no-reccomends in apt config to keep package
# sizes down.
#
# Podman defaults to trying to use systemd to do cgroup things (insert
# hand-wavy motion) but it's not in the container; override to use
# cgroupfs manager.  Also disable trying to send logs to the journal.
#
# The glibc in Fedora >35 uses clone3() which causes seccomp issues.
# For details see:
#  https://bugs.debian.org/995777
# We install podman from unstable until these fixes make it into bullseye
#
# For some reason, the unstable podman only suggests iptables (not
# recommends) so we need to pull that explicitly too.  Unclear if
# this is a feature or a bug; see:
#  https://bugs.debian.org/997976
#
# We are getting errors like
#  level=warning msg="\"/\" is not a shared mount, this could cause issues or missing mounts with rootless containers"
#  Error: command required for rootless mode with multiple IDs: exec: "newuidmap": executable file not found in $PATH
# on the production hosts (but not in the gate?).  uidmap is a
# recommended package, but we need to explicitly pull in its
# unstable requirements or it seems like apt decides just not install it.
# The problem is uidmap -> libsubid4 -> libsemanage2 -> libsemanage-common
# and so unless we have the unstable version of libsemanage-common, it won't
# install.
