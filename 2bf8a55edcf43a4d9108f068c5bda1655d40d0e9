That race could occur over seconds or even minutes as they performed cloud operations.  Whereas the additional skew introduced by using a cached node list is on the order of milliseconds.\n\nIt would me more correct to say that because multiple launchers do not coordinate with each other the limits are not guaranteed to be exact.",
