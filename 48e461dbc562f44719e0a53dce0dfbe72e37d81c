      "message": "Why are we polling rather than using t.join(timeout)? Also, its probably really useful to log the threads that we are waiting for, otherwise debugging this can be a nightmare. Oh, and is there some sane max timeout value we can pick where we just fail the test rather than blocking forever? Tests that fail by blocking forever make me sad.",

      "message": "I believe we poll because each test has a different set of non white listed threads (determined by the configuration for that particular test). Could enumerate them here though then join with a timeout. However each test already has a global timeout (see line 47) so not too worried about blocking forever.\n\nFinally this is just a small code reorg so that other test classes can use these utilities, any rewrite of the utilities themselves should go in another change.",
