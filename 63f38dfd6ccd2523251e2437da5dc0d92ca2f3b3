      "message": "The state machine driver is going to have a different implementation of this.  We could move it into the base class and then override it, but i didn\u0027t want to have any assumptions about a thread in the base class (but we could add a comment to remind us that some providers override it).  We could make a thin subclass with just this method.  But we have a lot of duplication in the providers anyway.  I guess they\u0027re all options.  :)",
