If that doesn\u0027t happen soon, well, we plan on removing db support from nodepool entirely eventually.",

      "message": "Note that the DB setup macros we have in our JJB config are not _required_ to be able to use databases in jobs. They exist as a transitional tool for projects that still expect the exact DB setup we used to bake into our snapshot images, pre-DIB. Any job can perform similar (or completely different) DB setup as it sees fit. Also, we have those macros broken down per-DB, so you _could_ just use the mysql macro(s) and not the ones for postgres if that\u0027s what you want.",
