      "message": "I feel pretty strongly we should not merge something that says we require postgres (and I think it reduces the utility of the bindep file for us to have to put a comment in it -- it means people can\u0027t trust it to install only the necessary packages).\n\nIf we make a change to the macros to only perform db init if the db is installed, then we can make the change I suggest.  If that doesn\u0027t happen soon, well, we plan on removing db support from nodepool entirely eventually.",

      "message": "Note that the DB setup macros we have in our JJB config are not _required_ to be able to use databases in jobs. They exist as a transitional tool for projects that still expect the exact DB setup we used to bake into our snapshot images, pre-DIB. Any job can perform similar (or completely different) DB setup as it sees fit. Also, we have those macros broken down per-DB, so you _could_ just use the mysql macro(s) and not the ones for postgres if that\u0027s what you want.",
