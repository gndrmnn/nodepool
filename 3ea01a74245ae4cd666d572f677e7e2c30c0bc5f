      "message": "How about checking to see if we can find the image on disk rather than assuming we will based on the hostname?  That may give us more flexibility in terms of how to construct builders (perhaps running more than one on a host, yet still having unique names, or having builders deposit their image files into a network filesystem, so they are automatically available to more upload workers).",
