      "message": "Since this runs synchronously I wonder what\u0027s the expected runtime of those api calls. I know that quite some api calls on our openstack clouds are in the order of seconds which is likely too slow to have it inside the critical path in the state machine.\n\nSo I think in order to really gain speed here in future we likely will need to move all remote api calls to the threadpool like the key scanning. I think a shared threadpool for all those actions might make sense.\n\nI think this would mimick the asyncio approach quite closely without giving up threads.",
