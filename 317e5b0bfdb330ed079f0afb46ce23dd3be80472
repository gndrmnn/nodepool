      "message": "I think there\u0027s a problem here -- imagine that we have previously had some trusty workers, so their functions are in the map.  Then they all get deleted.  Then we launch a bunch of jobs that need trusty workers.  We hit this point and worker_count will be 0, so nodepool won\u0027t see the demand for the workers.\n\nI think we want to do this check elsewhere.\n\nHowever, this point would be a good place to \u0027continue\u0027 if queued is 0 (we can \u0027else\u0027 the above conditional) -- there\u0027s no demand for this function, so no further processing of it is necessary.",
