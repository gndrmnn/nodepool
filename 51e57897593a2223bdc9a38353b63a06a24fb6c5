      "message": "Yes, because the max-servers value set in node.yaml is 96. The nodes list value is initially satisfied via min ready configuration of 1 for fake-label. Then when a new request comes in nodepool cannot fulfill that request using the existing node because its state is HOLD. Nodepool proceeds by provisioning a new node instead since it has max-servers headroom to do so. If it didn\u0027t have max-servers headroom it would pause and wait for space to become available.",
