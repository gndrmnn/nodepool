Developer setup:

Install dependencies:

sudo apt-get install git mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev g++ python-dev libzmq-dev
sudo pip install git-review
mkdir src
cd ~/src
git clone git://git.openstack.org/openstack-infra/config
git clone git://git.openstack.org/openstack-infra/nodepool
cd nodepool
git review -x XXXXX
sudo pip install -U -r requirements.txt
sudo pip install -e .

Note: In the "git review" line, that is where you'd specify any patches under
review that you wish to apply to your nodepool test instance.

Set up database:

mysql -u root

mysql> create database nodepool;
mysql> GRANT ALL ON nodepool.* TO 'nodepool'@'localhost';
mysql> flush privileges;

Export variable for your ssh key so you can log into the created instances:

export NODEPOOL_SSH_KEY=`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

Start nodepool with a demo config file (copy or edit fake.yaml
to contain your data):

nodepool -d -c tools/fake.yaml

All logging ends up in stdout.

Use the following tool to check on progress:

nodepool image-list

After each run (the fake nova provider is only in-memory):

mysql> delete from snapshot_image; delete from node;
