Nodepool
========

Nodepool is a service used by the OpenStack CI team to deploy and manage a pool
of devstack images on a cloud server for use in OpenStack project testing.

Developer setup
===============

Install dependencies:

sudo apt-get install git mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev g++ python-dev libzmq-dev
mkdir src
cd ~/src
git clone git://git.openstack.org/openstack-infra/config
git clone git://git.openstack.org/openstack-infra/nodepool
cd nodepool
sudo pip install -U -r requirements.txt
sudo pip install -e .

If you're testing a specific patch that is already in gerrit, you will also
want to install git-review and apply that patch while in the nodepool
directory, ie:

git review -x XXXXX

Set up database:

mysql -u root

mysql> create database nodepool;
mysql> GRANT ALL ON nodepool.* TO 'nodepool'@'localhost';
mysql> flush privileges;

Export variable for your ssh key so you can log into the created instances:

export NODEPOOL_SSH_KEY=`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

Start nodepool with a demo config file (copy or edit fake.yaml
to contain your data):

export STATSD_HOST=127.0.0.1
export STATSD_PORT=8125
nodepoold -d -c tools/fake.yaml

All logging ends up in stdout.

Use the following tool to check on progress:

nodepool image-list

After each run (the fake nova provider is only in-memory):

mysql> delete from snapshot_image; delete from node;
