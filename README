Developer setup:

Set up database:

mysql -u root

mysql> create database nodepool;
mysql> GRANT ALL ON nodepool.* TO 'nodepool'@'localhost';
mysql> flush privileges;

Export variable for your ssh key so you can log into the created instances:

export NODEPOOL_SSH_KEY=`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

Start nodepool with a demo config file (copy or edit fake.yaml
to contain your data):

nodepool -d -c tools/fake.yaml

All logging ends up in stdout.

Use the following tool to check on progress:

nodepool image-list

After each run (the fake nova provider is only in-memory):

mysql> delete from snapshot_image; delete from node;
