Developer setup:

If you want use the floating-ip, set the item "default_floating_pool" in nova.conf

mysql -u root

mysql> create database nodepool;
mysql> GRANT ALL ON nodepool.* TO 'nodepool'@'localhost';
mysql> flush privileges;

nodepool -d -c tools/fake.yaml

After each run (the fake nova provider is only in-memory):

mysql> delete from snapshot_image; delete from node;
