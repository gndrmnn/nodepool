Developer setup:

If the cloud being used has no default_floating_pool defined in nova.conf, you will need to define a pool name use nodepool.layout to use floating ips.

mysql -u root

mysql> create database nodepool;
mysql> GRANT ALL ON nodepool.* TO 'nodepool'@'localhost';
mysql> flush privileges;

nodepool -d -c tools/fake.yaml

After each run (the fake nova provider is only in-memory):

mysql> delete from snapshot_image; delete from node;
