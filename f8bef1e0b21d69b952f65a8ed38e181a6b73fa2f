      "message": "I\u0027d like to learn more and figure out a good way to present the right thing here. There is also a \u0027private: true\u0027 flag in clouds.yaml that should cause interface_ip to be filled with the private ip address (intended to be used to tell everything that you\u0027re operating in an environment where the private address is the one you\u0027re wanting to use)\n\nNow - I don\u0027t use that very often, and by not very often I mean never, so it\u0027s entirely possible something is broken with it, or that it\u0027s non-optimal in some way.\n\nBUT - my point is mainly, I totally understand what you\u0027re saying here, and I like to make sure that we provide to expressing that scenario so that nodepool can have the context to know what the right thing is. If we do that properly, we shouldn\u0027t need a private_ip column, right? Or do you have cases where you need to see both because as a human you may use one and may use the other sometimes?",

      "message": "I think we can use server.interface_ip as \"IP\" column, currently it\u0027s server.public_v4, I want to keep backward compatibility, so add the \"Private IP\" column. In my case, I just want to know available IP of servers, not both private and public IP, thank you reminding that",

      "message": "In my case, I build nodepool in my public cloud tenant as an internal CICD system, so the instance resources are shared between nodepool and other systems, this change just add a filter to output instances that related with nodepool according to metadata, that is more easy for operator to know which instance is created by nodepool, but don\u0027t exist in current zookeeper, that might should be deleted. I think nodepool should not care about the resources created by others, even if they\u0027re in same tenant.",
