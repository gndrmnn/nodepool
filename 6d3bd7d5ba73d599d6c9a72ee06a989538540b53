If we don\u0027t pass by task manager in the tests, it doesn\u0027t detect when the image is ready , so it keeps waiting forever for it. What do you think we could do here? All approaches i\u0027ve been thinking are more complex than this one.",

Since we aren\u0027t using the Task system anyways I think we should just go back to the code like it was in patchset 5. Take the old Task code and move it into the manager to make it synchronous.",
