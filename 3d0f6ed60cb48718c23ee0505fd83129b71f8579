      "message": "This line is key.  In our documentation:\n\n         The size of the root EBS volume, in GiB, for the image.  If\n         omitted, the volume size reported for the imported snapshot\n         will be used.  Only used with the\n         :value:`providers.[aws].diskimages.import-method.snapshot`\n         import method.\n\nRemoving this line would change the behavior so that users can no longer specify that an image should be created with a larger volume size than the snapshot.  That is something that makes sense to do: it\u0027s possible the user may know that even though a snapshot takes X GB, it\u0027s not actually usable without a root volume of X+Y GB.\n\nI think we should keep this and just correct the unit problem.",
