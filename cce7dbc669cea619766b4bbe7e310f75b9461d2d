      "message": "This builds Fedora 34 so is working (https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/diskimage-builder/+/815763)\n\nA tangential problem is that upstream Fedora 34 has a broken initramfs that practically doesn\u0027t boot on Xen and some other environments.  Switching to Fedora 35 is a logical step, but we have found this version of podman is broken due to https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug\u003d995777\n\nSo this is fine to get the gate going, but practically we\u0027ll need a different version going forward.",
