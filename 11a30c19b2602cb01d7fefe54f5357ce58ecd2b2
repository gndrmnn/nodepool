Then, just have nodepool read that on startup to identify its self?\n\nThen we\u0027d have it as a CLI option, defaulting to /etc/nodepool/myid.\n\nI\u0027m finding it a little odd to have builder-id-file here in nodepool.yaml, that\u0027s the reason for painting",

      "message": "The problem with /etc is that it should not be writable by nodepool, so we can\u0027t have it create it there.\n\nHowever, we do expect every builder to be able to write to its image build directory, so why don\u0027t we store the file there?  Then there\u0027s no need to specify the file location in the config.  The only circumstance where that would not work is if multiple builders used shared storage for the images.\n\n(To be honest, that might even be okay.  We\u0027re really trying to identify \"builders which should have access to this image on disk\".  If there\u0027s more than one of those, maybe it\u0027s okay for them to have the same ID.)",
