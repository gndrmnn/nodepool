      "message": "I dont understand what the reasoning is for storing these locks / raising on exception on re-acquiring them. Is the goal to create a deadlock check because we know a single thread should never acquire one of these twice? It\u0027d be nice to have a comment to that effect if so.\n\n\nI\u0027m also curious if this is the whole cause for the comment above about only use this class from a single thread? If so, a random thought for the future is to just store these vars inside of threading.local and the thread-unsafe issue would go away...\n\n\nNeither of these are -1 worthy, but we could add some comments in a later change.",
