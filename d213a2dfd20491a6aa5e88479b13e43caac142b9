We randomize the db etc, this is also guaranteeing we are using an isolated user (which seems to be the intent of randomizing the user) not accidentally utilizing a \"previous\" user.\n\nThe alternative would be to use openstack_citest or a single user for all of the opportunistic tests. We could also simply use self.name again.",
