I think we could also up the log level to \"warning\"\n3. (nit) Logs should use %-formatting (`log.info(\"...%s ...\", variable`) instead of f-strings\n\nMore generally I\u0027m wondering if we can always be sure that the `NotEmptyError` is the result of a race between the SM and the worker trying to delete the same node. Another question would be if we want to execute `self.manager.nodeDeletedNotification(node)` in this case.",
