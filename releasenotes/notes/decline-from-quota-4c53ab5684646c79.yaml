    A new configuration option ``decline-from-quota`` is added for the
    OpenStack driver. If True (the default and previous behavior), a provider
    will decline a node request if there is not sufficient quota to satisfy it.
    If False, the request will be accepted, but will wait until sufficient
    quota is available to be fulfilled.
