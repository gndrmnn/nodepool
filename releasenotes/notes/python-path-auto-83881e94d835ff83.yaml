    The default ``python-path`` is now ``auto`` (instead of
    ``/usr/bin/python2``).  With this, Zuul will set the
    ``ansible_python_interpreter`` to ``auto`` when using Ansible
    >=2.8 to use `automated interpreter discovery
    <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/interpreter_discovery.html>`__.
    When using earlier Ansible, it will remain the old default of
    ``/usr/bin/python2``.

    This will remove the need to override python-path explicitly for
    Python 3-only distributions, which should be detected correctly
    automatically.
