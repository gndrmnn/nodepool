    The Kubernetes driver now supports adding dynamic metadata, i.e. Pod and
    Namespace labels, with information about the corresponding node request.
    This is analogous to the existing dynamic tags of the OpenStack, AWS, and
    Azure drivers.

    See :attr:`providers.[kubernetes].pools.labels.dynamic-labels` for details.
