    Added the option to configure runtimeClassName for the Openshift and
    Openshift Pods drivers to use non-default container runtimes in openshift.
    For example this enables running workloads in kata containers by using
    the Openshift Sandboxed Container Operator and configuring an openshift pod
    label with `runtime-class-name: kata`.
