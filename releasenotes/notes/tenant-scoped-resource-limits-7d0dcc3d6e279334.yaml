    Add Tenant-Scoped Resource Quota

    Adding the option to put quota on resources on a per-tenant basis (i.e.
    Zuul tenants).

    It adds a new top-level config structure ``tenant-resource-limits`` under
    which one can specify a number of tenants, each with ``max-servers``,
    ``max-cores``, and ``max-ram`` limits.  These limits are valid globally,
    i.e., for all providers. This is contrary to currently existing provider
    and pool quotas, which only are consindered for nodes of the same provider.
    This feature is optional and tenant quotas are ignored for any NodeRequests
    that do not deliver tenant information with them. Also no quota is
    evaluated for tenants that have no limits configured for them.
