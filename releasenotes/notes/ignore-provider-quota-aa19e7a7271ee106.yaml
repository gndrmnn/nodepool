    A new boolean pool variable ````ignore-provider-quota`` has been added to
    allow the provider quota to be ignored for a pool. Instead, nodepool only
    checks against the ``max-cores``, ``max-servers`` and ``max-ram`` values
    for the pool and the current usage based on stored data. This may be useful
    in circumstances where the provider is incorrectly calculating quota.
