    The 4.0.0 release of Nodepool is not substantially different than
    3.14 and is compatible with Zuul versions 3.19 and 4.0.  Nodepool
    and Zuul versions are not generally synchronized, but we elected
    to increase the Nodepool major version to match the 4.0 release of
    Zuul for clarity.
