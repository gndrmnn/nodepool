    The ``TaskManager`` used by the OpenStack provider has been removed.
    The ``keystoneauth1`` library underneath ``openstacksdk`` has grown
    support for rate limiting using a ``FairSemaphore`` instead of a pool
    of worker threads. This should reduce the overall thread count. However,
    due to this it is now openstacksdk making the statsd calls, which means
    the statsd keys are no longer transformed.
