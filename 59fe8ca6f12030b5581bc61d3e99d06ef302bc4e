      "message": "As noted in Icbf19a25a8b555f1289ff9efb368e9e5cd4740ab the nodepool user actually needs access to create databases as well to store information about the systems it creates in their own databases. I\u0027d copy the database creation information from that change.\n\nYou may also note that this MySQL instance should be for nodepool usage only since we\u0027re giving it free rein on the database.",

      "message": "If I understood Icbf19a25a8b555f1289ff9efb368e9e5cd4740ab correctly it sounds like the ability to create own databases only applies to testing and is not needed in production. Do we really want to include that kind of detail for the installation doc since I would consider what\u0027s in this installation.rst file  to be recommendations for production setup.\n\nI feel like including test requirements in this section would only serve to confuse users. Let me know if I misunderstood anything.",
